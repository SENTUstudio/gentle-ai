# GGA Specification

## Purpose

Defines the install and runtime behavior of the GGA component, covering the PowerShell shim asset and its Windows-specific install step.

## Requirements

### Requirement: PowerShell Shim Asset

The system MUST embed a `gga.ps1` file as a Go asset under `internal/assets/gga/`. The shim MUST delegate execution to the Git Bash binary resolved by `gitBashPath()`, forwarding all arguments verbatim and propagating the exit code.

#### Scenario: Shim delegates to Git Bash

- GIVEN the embedded `gga.ps1` is installed on a Windows machine with Git Bash present
- WHEN the user runs `gga <subcommand>` from PowerShell
- THEN the shim invokes Git Bash with the resolved bash binary path and all supplied arguments
- AND the process exits with the same code returned by the underlying GGA bash command

#### Scenario: Arguments containing spaces are forwarded correctly

- GIVEN `gga.ps1` is installed
- WHEN the user runs `gga commit -m "my message"` from PowerShell
- THEN the argument `"my message"` reaches GGA as a single token (not split)

#### Scenario: Exit code propagation on error

- GIVEN `gga.ps1` is installed
- WHEN the underlying GGA command exits with a non-zero code
- THEN PowerShell's `$LASTEXITCODE` reflects that exact non-zero value

---

### Requirement: Windows Install Step

On Windows, the installer MUST write `gga.ps1` to the same directory as the GGA bash script after GGA's own `install.sh` completes. The write MUST use an atomic no-op pattern: if the file already exists with identical content, the installer MUST NOT overwrite it.

#### Scenario: First-time install on Windows

- GIVEN GGA has completed its own install
- AND `gga.ps1` does not yet exist in the install directory
- WHEN the Windows install step runs
- THEN `gga.ps1` is written to the install directory with correct content

#### Scenario: Idempotent re-install (content unchanged)

- GIVEN `gga.ps1` already exists with content matching the current embedded asset
- WHEN the installer runs again
- THEN the file is NOT overwritten (no write I/O occurs)

#### Scenario: Stale shim is updated

- GIVEN `gga.ps1` exists but its content differs from the current embedded asset
- WHEN the installer runs
- THEN the file is atomically replaced with the new content

#### Scenario: Git Bash not found at install time

- GIVEN Git Bash is not installed on the target Windows machine
- WHEN the install step attempts to resolve `gitBashPath()`
- THEN the installer surfaces a clear, actionable error message
- AND installation halts without writing a broken shim

---

### Requirement: Non-Windows Systems Unaffected

On non-Windows platforms, the installer MUST NOT attempt to write `gga.ps1` or invoke the PowerShell shim step.

#### Scenario: Linux/macOS install flow unchanged

- GIVEN a Linux or macOS host
- WHEN GGA install runs
- THEN no `.ps1` file is created and no Windows-specific code path executes

---

### Requirement: Welcome Screen — OpenCode SDD Profiles Option

The Welcome screen MUST include a new menu option "OpenCode SDD Profiles"
positioned after "Configure Models". When at least one non-default profile
exists, the option MUST display the current profile count as a badge:
`"OpenCode SDD Profiles (N)"`. Selecting this option navigates to the
profile list screen.

#### Scenario: Welcome shows profile count badge

- GIVEN two non-default profiles (`cheap`, `gemini`) exist in `opencode.json`
- WHEN the Welcome screen renders
- THEN the menu option reads `"OpenCode SDD Profiles (2)"`

#### Scenario: Welcome shows option without badge when no profiles exist

- GIVEN no non-default profiles exist (only the default `sdd-orchestrator`)
- WHEN the Welcome screen renders
- THEN the menu option reads `"OpenCode SDD Profiles"` (no badge)

#### Scenario: Selecting option navigates to profile list

- GIVEN the cursor is on "OpenCode SDD Profiles"
- WHEN the user presses enter
- THEN the TUI navigates to `ScreenProfiles`

---

### Requirement: Sync `--profile` Flag

The `sync` CLI subcommand MUST accept a `--profile name:provider/model` flag.
Multiple instances of the flag on the same invocation MUST be accepted and
each creates or updates the named profile. Profile creation via `--profile`
MUST produce the same agent structure as TUI-based creation.

A companion `--profile-phase` flag MUST accept `name:phase:provider/model`
to assign an individual phase model within a named profile.

#### Scenario: `--profile` creates new profile during sync

- GIVEN `cheap` does not exist in `opencode.json`
- WHEN `gentle-ai sync --profile cheap:anthropic/claude-haiku-3.5-20241022` runs
- THEN `sdd-orchestrator-cheap` and 10 sub-agents are added to `opencode.json`
- AND the sync proceeds normally

#### Scenario: `--profile` flag with invalid format rejected

- GIVEN `gentle-ai sync --profile badformat` is run (no colon separator)
- WHEN argument parsing runs
- THEN the command exits with a usage error: "invalid --profile format: expected name:provider/model"

#### Scenario: `--profile-phase` overrides a specific sub-agent model

- GIVEN `gentle-ai sync --profile cheap:haiku --profile-phase cheap:sdd-apply:sonnet`
- WHEN sync runs
- THEN `sdd-apply-cheap.model = sonnet`
- AND all other `cheap` sub-agents use `haiku`

## Doc Note

`docs/platforms.md` MUST remove any Windows limitation note that states PowerShell is unsupported once this change ships. This is a documentation-only update with no behavioral requirement beyond keeping the doc accurate.
